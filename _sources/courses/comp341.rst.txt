About
=====

This course studies the interaction between humans and computer-based systems. The course will provide students with methods for evaluating, designing, and developing better interfaces between humans and computer-based systems.

Description
===========

The course has been structured to provide logical, contiguous groupings of material relative to considerations of design and human interaction with computer-based systems. The student is exposed to design components and elements that help us develop interactions with such systems. This is complemented by a sound and clear understanding of the logic and psychological reasoning for such patterns and design choices. Examples are available throughout the course, and theory is offered alongside demonstration.

Outcome
=======

Students will acquire an awareness of different design and evaluation methods as well as practical, effective, and cost-conscience methods for improving systems and their interfaces.
