About
=====

This course introduces key data structures such as lists, sets, and maps, as well as their implementations. Performance and analysis of algorithms are covered along with applications in sorting and searching.

Description
===========

This course studies basic data structures including array lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and hash tables.  Efficiency of data structure operations, study of recursion, applications of data structures, and simple analysis of algorithms are covered.

Outcome
=======

Students learn linear data structures and the performance of their operations, and they learn to solve simple computational problems by designing suitable algorithms and efficient data structures.
