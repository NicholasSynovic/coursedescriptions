About
=====

This course introduces key data structures such as lists, sets, and maps, as well as their implementations. Performance and analysis of algorithms are covered along with applications in sorting and searching.


Description
===========

This course introduces key data structures such as array lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and hash structures such as sets and maps. Both use and implementation are covered. Efficiency of data structure operations, study of recursion, applications of data structures, and simple analysis of algorithms are covered.

Outcome
=======

Students will be able to describe linear data structures and analyze the performance of their operations. Students will be able to select appropriate data structures to integrate into algorithms to solve computational problems.
