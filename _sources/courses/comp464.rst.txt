About
=====

This course is motivated by the realization that CPU speeds are leveling off at between 3GHz and 5GHz.

Description
===========

The need for programs to be faster and more efficient is all the more important at a time when applications are getting increasingly larger and more complex. We will introduce techniques to gain a performance boost in Java programs and C++ (or C) programs by discussing the use of multiple processors. This course will use two kinds of hardware platforms we have in the department, two IBM symmetric multiprocessors with 4 CPUs each and 4 GB of memory and a cluster of AMD machines all running Linux. We will study shared memory (OpenMP), message passing (MPI), and hybrid models of programming the high-performance machines.

Outcome
=======

This course will use a blend of foundational understanding as well as a set of practical tools to gain insight into the performance engineering of software.
