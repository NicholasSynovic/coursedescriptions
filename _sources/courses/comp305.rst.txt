About
=====

Business and scientific institutions increasingly use large commercial database systems. This course teaches the theory and practices for the definition, security, backup, tuning, and recovery of these systems.

Description
===========

Businesses and scientific institutions have started using commercial-grade database servers increasingly. Hence it has become important to install, configure, and manage the servers in an efficient manner to increase productivity. Several tasks involved in maintaining a database server is quite different from say administering a computer system or a network. A deeper knowledge of the storage aspects of the server and how different server processes work are needed for the successful administration of the server. Typically, the database administrator cares for the security of data, backup and recovery, and space management. This course takes a user through the stages of setting up a database server environment, designing a database, and finally tuning.

Outcome
=======

Students will be able to use theory and pragmatic approaches to define and implement realistic solutions for large database administration environments.
