About
=====

The course introduces techniques for understanding and developing dynamic and interactive media by using sound, motion, images, and text. Relevant software knowledge areas are covered.


Description
===========

Computer animation of multimedia objects is increasingly used in web publishing and in projects for product marketing. The purpose of this the course is to introduce interactive elements in multimedia creation using computer animation and using simple programming components for interactivity. The course will teach techniques to create dynamic and interactive content using Macromediaâ€™s Flash software. Examples of interactivity include the ability to change the animation upon user input, as in a flying plane unveiling a banner when the user touches it or upon the expiration of a timer, as in rain turning to snow in 5 seconds or other event-driven systems. The course is appropriate for anyone interested in using computers to design, and publish simple graphical animations including web developers, and graphic artists. The salient feature of the course is that very little programming knowledge is needed although students should be comfortable in using software tools and be able to think logically to write simple, programming segments in a special language called Actionscript.

Outcome
=======

Ability to publish created animated media projects to the web in a process that involves understanding human interface design.
