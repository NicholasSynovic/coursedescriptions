About
=====

This course introduces the formal foundations of cryptography and also investigates some well-known standards and protocols, including private and public-key cryptosystems, hashing, digital signatures, RSA, DSS, PGP, and related topics.

Description
===========

This course introduces the formal foundations of cryptography and also investigates some well-known standards and protocols. The intended audience is senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students. The course will include topics selected from the following: information-theoretic security, private key encryption, DES, public key encryption, background on modular arithmetic, RSA, hashing, and message authentication codes (MACs), digital signatures, DSS, key distribution and management, PGP, network security, and Fiat-Shamir protocol.

Outcome
=======

Students will gain an understanding of cryptosystems widely used to protect data security on the internet, and be able to apply the ideas in new situations as needed.
