About
=====

This course studies the architecture, design, and implementation of concurrent software systems.

Description
===========

Process algebras, formal specification, and testing are used as tools in the engineering of concurrent systems; event-based programming frameworks and thread libraries are employed in the implementation of such systems. Coursework includes several substantial programming projects (in a language such as Java) involving applications of concurrency and event-driven programming such as graphical user interfaces and distributed services using Remote Method Invocation (RMI).

Outcome
=======

Students will have an uderstanding of process algebras, formal specification,, testing, event-based programming frameworks and thread libraries.
