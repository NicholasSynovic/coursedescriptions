Fill out the `Request for Course Title form <http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/gradschool/pdfs/Request%20for%20Course%20Title.pdf>`_ and get the signature of your supervisor and the GPD. More information can be found in the `Graduate Program Handbook <https://graduatehandbook.cs.luc.eduregulations.html#independent-study>`_.

Outcome
=======

The student will conduct research on a project with the support of Loyola faculty.
