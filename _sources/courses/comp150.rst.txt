About
=====

The world overflows with electronic data.  This course introduces programming in a simple, powerful language like Python, with selection, repetition, functions, graphical effects, and dynamic interaction with the Internet, plus connections to lower level computer organization and computer implications in the wider world.

Description
===========

This course provides a broad survey introducing the many layers of the computer science discipline, emphasizing the computer’s role and limitations as a tool for describing, organizing, and manipulating information applicable to many disciplines. Topics include binary logic expressed in electronic circuitry, machine architecture, basic programming in the very accessible language Python, data organization, the potential and limitations of machines, and useful tools.

This course serves as a terminal course for students who want a one-course introduction to the field, as well as a preliminary course to upper-level computer science offerings.

Outcome
=======

Empowerment to manage and transform masses of data; understanding of technical, societal, and ethical issues involved.
