About
=====

Codes with an algebraic structure for error control are examined.

Description
===========

Block codes including Hamming codes and Reed-Muller codes, BCH codes, and other cyclic codes with algebraic structure and their implementation are treated. Other topics may include convolutional codes, efficiency considerations, and Shannon's fundamental theorem of information theory.

Outcome
=======

Students will learn both the theory and application of error-correcting codes.
