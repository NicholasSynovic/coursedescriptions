About
=====

Networks today are high-speed, heterogeneous, large-scale, and delivers different media including data, audio, and video. How do you effectively manage todayâ€™s complex computer networks?

Description
===========

This class provides complete yet accessible answers to network managers and researchers in this field. The course covers the basics of network management, alternative architectures, evaluation techniques, network management system components, SNMP and CMIP management protocols, and the ISO network management applications: fault management, performance management, configuration management, security management, and accounting management. The course emphasizes the practical experience of developing networks and distributed systems management tools using the SNMP++ and AdventNet wrappers. This course also highlights the latest advances in networks and distributed management areas and shows case studies of academic and industrial systems such as HiFi, SMARRT, OpenView, NetView, and Tivoli.
