  If you declared your major before to Fall 2021, please follow the :doc:`msse_old` page.

********
Overview
********

The M.S. in Software Engineering caters to students interested in software engineering and also other contemporary topics of long-term value to the industry. Most early careers in the industry are based on either software development or managerial aspects of software development. This degree places more weight on software development. For those seeking a greater focus on managerial aspects, we offer the :doc:`msit`.

**********
Curriculum
**********

* Each program requires a total of 30 credit hours
    * Generally 10 three-credit courses
* Students can receive up to 6 credit hours (replacing two of our courses) for graduate work taken elsewhere
    * See the `transfer credit section of the Graduate Student Handbook <https://graduatehandbook.cs.luc.edu/regulations.html#transfer-credit>`_ for details.

.. important::

  Students who have taken undergraduate Loyola classes:

  Many 400-level courses in the department have closely related 300-level analogues, e.g. :doc:`../courses/comp443` and :doc:`../courses/comp343`. Students who enter the MS program after taking a Loyola course in this category must choose to take 400-level courses that are not closely related to any 300-level courses taken earlier, unless they have GPD permission.

Overall, to achieve depth and breadth, Software Engineering students must complete the following:

* Two (2) required courses addressing ethical and social issues in the computing field and a firm base in object-oriented programming.
* Three (3) courses from restricted categories to ensure a strong software engineering center, while still allowing a considerable the flexibility of interests.
* Five (5) courses or 15 credits that are general electives.

Major Prerequisites
===================

A four-year undergraduate degree in any field. Computer science, software engineering, computer engineering, or related background recommended.

Preperation Courses
-------------------

All of these courses must be taken if you do not have a four-year undergraduate degree in a related field.

* :doc:`../courses/comp400a`
* :doc:`../courses/comp400b`
* :doc:`../courses/comp400c`
* :doc:`../courses/comp400d`

.. warning::

  Students may not use an introductory course to satisfy a foundation or elective requirement.

  Preparatory courses do not count towards the 30 required credit hours of non-preparatory courses.

A student taking any necessary preparation course is considered to be a full-fledged student of the Graduate School. Preparation courses may be taken in the same semester as other graduate courses, provided the prerequisites for the other graduate courses are met. Students are expected, however, to take all necessary preparation courses early in their career.

A student may place out of an introductory course under any of the following conditions:

* The student has appropriate coursework equivalent to the introductory course.
* The student has appropriate and verified professional experience equivalent to the introductory course.
* The student passes a Graduate Competency Assessment (GCA) in the introductory course area.
* This can be waived under the discretion of the GPD.

If a student has had a preparatory course waived, departmental assistance will usually be necessary to allow the student to register for any other course having that preparatory course as a prerequisite.

Major Requirements
==================

* :doc:`../courses/comp413`
* :doc:`../courses/comp417`

.. important::

    :doc:`../courses/comp413` is a prerequisite to many other courses.

Restricted Electives
====================

MSSE students must take nine (9) credits of restricted electives.

MSSE students must take **at least one** course from the following **Group 1** list:

.. important::
  Most of these Group 1 courses require :doc:`../courses/comp413` as a prerequisite.

  Exceptions are  :doc:`../courses/comp424`, :doc:`../courses/comp474`, and :doc:`../courses/comp460`.

* :doc:`../courses/comp424`
* :doc:`../courses/comp433`
* :doc:`../courses/comp434`
* :doc:`../courses/comp437`
* :doc:`../courses/comp439`
* :doc:`../courses/comp442`
* :doc:`../courses/comp460`
* :doc:`../courses/comp471`
* :doc:`../courses/comp473`
* :doc:`../courses/comp474`

MSSE students must also take **two additional** courses from *either* **Group 1** or the following **Group 2** list:

* :doc:`../courses/comp410`
* :doc:`../courses/comp412`
* :doc:`../courses/comp420`
* :doc:`../courses/comp436`
* :doc:`../courses/comp441`
* :doc:`../courses/comp453`
* :doc:`../courses/comp464`

.. note::

    :doc:`../courses/comp363` might be required as a prerequisite for some of the courses in Group 1 and Group 2.

If a student enters the program with an academic record of success in a a course similar to :doc:`../courses/comp413`, or if the student can demonstrate programming experience with the concepts of :doc:`../courses/comp413`, then the GPD may substitute for the :doc:`../courses/comp413` requirement a course in Group 1 or 2 that has :doc:`../courses/comp413` as a prerequisite.

The Computer Science department may declare that other courses (e.g. new courses and individual :doc:`../courses/comp488` offerings) may count as members of either Group 1 or Group 2.

General Electives
=================

MSSE students must take fifteen (15) credits of other electives.

Electives can be any COMP 400 level class.

The elective course options are common for all programs,
differing only in the total number of credits required.

There are numerous options for independent study,
including a programming project, research, or a service-oriented project.


.. important::

  Students may take up to a maximum of 6 credit hours of :doc:`../courses/comp490` and/or :doc:`../courses/comp499`.
