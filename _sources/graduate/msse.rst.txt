    M.S. in Software Engineering


M.S. in Software Engineering
============================

Overview
---------

The M.S. in Software Engineering caters to students interested in software engineering and also other contemporary topics of long-term value to the industry. Most early careers in the industry are based on either software development or managerial aspects of software development. This degree places more weight on software development. For those seeking a greater focus on managerial aspects, we offer the :doc:`msit`.

Curriculum
----------

This program is for students entering the program in Spring 2014 or later. If you were enrolled in the program before Spring 2014 you may use the older degree requirements located at `here <http://luc.edu/cs/academics/graduateprograms/msse/oldcurriculum/>`_.

.. * See the :doc:`masters_prereqs`.

* Each program requires a total of 30 credit hours, generally 10 three-credit courses.
* Students can receive up to 6 credit hours (replacing two of our courses) for graduate work taken elsewhere: See the `transfer credit section of the Graduate Student Handbook <https://graduatehandbook.cs.luc.edu/regulations.html#transfer-credit>`_ for details.
* **Students who have taken undergraduate Loyola classes**: Many 400-level courses in the department have closely related 300-level analogues, e.g. :doc:`../courses/comp443` and :doc:`../courses/comp343`. Students who enter the MS program after taking a Loyola course in this category must choose to take 400-level courses that are not closely related to any 300-level courses taken earlier, unless they have GPD permission.

Overall, to achieve depth and breadth, Software Engineering students must complete the following:

*   Two (2) required courses addressing ethical and social issues in the computing field and a firm base in object-oriented programming.
*   Three (3) courses from restricted categories to ensure a strong software engineering center, while still allowing a considerable the flexibility of interests.
*   Five (5) courses or 15 credits that are general electives.

Major Requirements (6 credits)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*   :doc:`../courses/comp413` (prereq to some other courses - take early!)
*   :doc:`../courses/comp417`

Restricted Electives (9 credits)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MSSE students must take at least one course from the following Group 1 list:

Group 1
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp424`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp433`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp434`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp437`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp439`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp442`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp460`

        .. note::
            Special prereq, :doc:`../courses/comp363`.

    *   :doc:`../courses/comp471`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp473`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp474`

Most of these Group 1 courses require :doc:`../courses/comp413` as a prerequisite. Exceptions are Comp 424, 474, and 460.

MSSE students must also take two additional courses from either the list above or the following Group 2 list:

Group 2
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp410`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp412`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp420`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp436`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp441`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp453`
    *   :doc:`../courses/comp464`

If a student enters the program with an academic record of success in a a course similar to :doc:`../courses/comp413`, or if the student can demonstrate programming experience with the concepts of :doc:`../courses/comp413`, then the Graduate Program Director may substitute for the :doc:`../courses/comp413` requirement a course in Group 1 or 2 that has :doc:`../courses/comp413` as a prerequisite. The Computer Science department may declare that other courses (eg new courses and individual :doc:`../courses/comp488` offerings) may count as members of either Group 1 or Group 2.

General Electives (15 Credits)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The elective course options are common for all programs,
differing only in the total number of credits required.

Electives can be any COMP 400 level class.

Students may take up to a maximum of 6 credit hours of
:doc:`../courses/comp490` and/or :doc:`../courses/comp499`.

There are numerous options for independent study,
including a programming project, research, or a service-oriented project.
