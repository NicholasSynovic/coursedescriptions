Game design and development continues to evolve and grow, now encompassing media, engineering, design, and many related facets of hardware and software development. Designing, developing, and publishing a competitive game requires a broad understanding and clear appreciation of software engineering. Performance, optimization, and clear design are critical features of a successful game, in particular for mobile platforms. Gaming continues to explore new options for design and development, including mobile, cloud, machine learning, AI, VR, and recent options for AR.
