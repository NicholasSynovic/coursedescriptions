Description
===========

This path is for students who want to extract meaningful, actionable information from unstructured, potentially large data sets. From a practical point of view, data scientists must be able to program sufficiently to work with data sets from a variety of databases and unstructured data sets and potentially create the tools needed for others to do the same. Data scientists require strong analytical and statistical skills, as they are often required to create complex models for statistical inferences on large data sets, however, they also develop communication skills to succinctly and accurately provide actionable information to decision-makers at all levels.
