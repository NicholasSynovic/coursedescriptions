Description
===========

Organizations are overwhelmed with data, including conventional, tabular, transaction processing data, unstructured data, real-time data from sensors, “big data”, and smaller, desktop business intelligence.  A Data Architect collaborates with IT, domain users, and management to set standards and policies and develop the models that best serve the enterprise’s data needs, thus creating the organization’s data architecture.  A solid understanding of data modeling is required, as well as the ability to synthesize multiple user information requirements into one cohesive architecture.
