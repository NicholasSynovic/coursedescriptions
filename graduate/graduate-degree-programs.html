<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>If you were a Loyola Undergraduate who declared a CS, IT, SE, etc. major prior to Fall 2019, you do not have to worry about taking <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp272.html"><span class="doc">COMP 272: Data Structures II</span></a> as the content was covered in <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp271.html"><span class="doc">COMP 271: Data Structures I</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<p>All students need the equivalent knowledge of <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp170.html"><span class="doc">COMP 170: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp271.html"><span class="doc">COMP 271: Data Structures I</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp272.html"><span class="doc">COMP 272: Data Structures II</span></a>. This knowledge is a prerequisite to essentially all the graduate courses in the Computer Science Department with the exception of <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp417.html"><span class="doc">COMP 417: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues in Computing</span></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="m-s-in-computer-science">
<h3>M.S in Computer Science<a class="headerlink" href="#m-s-in-computer-science" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Students in the Computer Science Graduate Program need the strongest preparation. Most will have an undergraduate degree or at least the first two years of foundational undergraduate courses.  This would include the addition of equivalents of our <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp163.html"><span class="doc">COMP 163: Discrete Structures</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp264.html"><span class="doc">COMP 264: Introduction to Computer Systems</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp363.html"><span class="doc">COMP 363: Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms</span></a> to the two courses already listed above.

<div class="section" id="missing-prerequisites">
<h3>Missing Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#missing-prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you are missing prerequisites, you can fulfill the requirements by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Taking them somewhere else
* However, while possibly cheaper and more convenient to your location, there is the possibility that the education you recieve will not be as good or covers what we want from our students</p></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Taking them at Loyola:</dt><dd><ul>
<li><p>This can be done before entering the Graduate program as a non-degree undergrad resulting in a cheaper undergraduate tuition.</p></li>
<li><p>You can get both prerequisites in one semester with our special compressed sections of <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp170.html"><span class="doc">COMP 170: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp271.html"><span class="doc">COMP 271: Data Structures I</span></a>.

</ul>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>The compressed prerequisites can be taken after admission to the graduate program. Then you become a full-time graduate student if you add a third course - a graduate course not requiring the prerequisites resulting in a faster full-time program completion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compressed-prep-courses">
<h4>Compressed Prep Courses<a class="headerlink" href="#compressed-prep-courses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the Fall or Spring semesters, you have the opportunity to take a compressed intensive sequence of the <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp170.html"><span class="doc">COMP 170: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp271.html"><span class="doc">COMP 271: Data Structures I</span></a> prerequisites in one semester. This course consists of two 7-8 weeks courses in succession, each with the same total contact hours of regular 15-week courses (6.25 credit hours).</p>
<p>To be a full-time graduate student at the same time, the most common additional course is  the required <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp417.html"><span class="doc">COMP 417: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues in Computing</span></a>, which has no prerequisite.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp170.html"><span class="doc">COMP 170: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming</span></a> does not require any background in programming, but if you have no backgound in programming, then it is important to have a math background in which you are comfortable with the material in a precalculus course like our <a class="reference external" href="http://luc.edu/math/academics/courses/math118/index.shtml">MATH 118: Precalculus</a>, which includes significant manipulation of functions and logical symbolic progressions.</p>
<p>If you have a previous modest introduction to programming, including defining and using functions, then the formal math background is not so important.</p>
<p>Students who neither have this math background nor any programming at all may want to get a more gentle introduction to programming first, as in our <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp150.html"><span class="doc">COMP 150: Introduction to Computing</span></a>. It is offered in the Fall and Spring semesters and online during the summer.</p>
<p>If you do need the extra preparation, then this will slow you down by a semester.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Many transitioning students with full-time jobs have found the compressed prerequisite course to be too rigourous to take on even without an additional grad course.</p>

<div class="section" id="basic-programming-prerequisites">
<h4>Basic Programming Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-programming-prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Knowledge of the content below is a prerequisite for almost all of the graduate courses in the Computer Science Department. The descriptions below are for the courses at Loyola, in a pretty standard introductory sequence. If you took these subjects elsewhere, you are not likely to have the exact the same collection of topics, but if you are close, there should not be much problem filling holes as needed.</p>

<h5>Expectations from COMP 170<a class="headerlink" href="#expectations-from-comp-170" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>List of top ten concepts you should understand at the end of <a class="reference internal" href="../courses/comp170.html"><span class="doc">COMP 170: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming</span></a> in Java, C#, C++ or a similar language:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Be able to distinguish between class and instance
* Class is an abstract representation or model (class aka type, abstract type, factory for objects). The class has field definitions (or attribute definitions) and operations (or methods) to implement their behaviors.
* Instance (aka class instance, variable) is an actual, specific, concrete thing and has specific field values (or attribute values).
* All instances of a class share the same operations and attribute definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>Know syntax rules and coding style
* Learn the basic picky rules of syntax and use them correctly. Key items: placement of “;” use of case (“ClassSchedule” vs. “classSchedule”); distinguish declarations and executable statements.
* Format code readably according to agreed-upon style.</p></li>
<li><p>Use conditional control structures fully and correctly
* Construct programs with “if….then”, and “if….then…else”. Understand the nesting of control statements and blocks ( “{“ and “}”).
* Briefly, “Nesting, blocks, no dangles”.</p></li>
<li><p>Construct loops with control structures
* Use “while”, “do”, and “for” control structures to implement algorithms successfully.
* Briefly, “avoid never-ending loops, avoid off-by-one problems”</p></li>
<li><p>Use the primitive types and operators appropriately
* Understand the use and limitations of the primitive types.
* Know the most useful arithmetic, relational, and logical operators and use them in expressions, with parentheses when necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to create good Object Oriented encapsulation
* Achieve a deep understanding of the proper use of the access modifiers “private”, and “public”.
* Be able to design well-structured classes.
* Know when and how to use “static”.</p></li>
<li><p>Construct and understand methods fully
* Define and use methods, including formal parameters and return values.
* Distinguish between formal parameters (aka parameters) and arguments in the call to a method.
* Comprehend scope and lifetime of objects. Understand the visibility of objects and how to implement finding the right object at the necessary time.
* Know how to ask a particular instance of a class to do something. Know how to construct associations between classes.
* Understand what is happening is a nested stack of method calls.</p></li>
<li><p>Be knowledgeable about important library container classes and arrays
* Be able to declare and use container objects like for lists and arrays. Understand how to find things in containers and arrays. Use index variables effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform simple input/output processing
* Learn how to do basic input and output statements with an interactive user and with files. Be able to work with Strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand Object Oriented Interfaces</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Pursuing Multiple M.S. Degrees<a class="headerlink" href="#pursuing-multiple-m-s-degrees" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We are often asked about whether it is possible to complete more than one M.S. degree (e.g. an <a class="reference internal" href="mscs.html"><span class="doc">M.S. in Computer Science</span></a> and an <a class="reference internal" href="msse.html"><span class="doc">M.S. in Software Engineering</span></a>). The answer is <strong>no</strong> <em>unless</em> you complete 54 hours of study. 30 hours of courses for each degree, except for 6 credits transferred into the second degree.</p>
<p>It is impractical and expensive, and we don’t think it serves students well. Our goal is to prepare you for a serious career (professional and/or academic) after completing <em>one</em> graduate degree.</p>

<div class="section" id="non-degree-and-continuing-education-students">
<h3>Non-Degree and Continuing Education Students<a class="headerlink" href="#non-degree-and-continuing-education-students" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Students who wish to continue taking courses may do so after completing their degree as non-degree students. We also encourage our students to maintain connections through our professional and social networking groups. Many of our students continue to be involved in research laboratories such as the Emerging Technologies Laboratory (see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.etl.luc.edu">http://www.etl.luc.edu</a>).</p>
